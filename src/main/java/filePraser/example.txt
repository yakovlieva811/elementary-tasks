The 2012 transit of Venus, when the planet Venus appeared as a small, dark spot passing across the face
 of the Sun, began at 22:09 UTC on 5 June 2012, and finished at 04:49 UTC on 6 June.[1] Depending on the 
position of the observer, the exact times varied by up to ±7 minutes. Transits of Venus are among the rarest
 of predictable celestial phenomena and occur in pairs. Consecutive transits per pair are spaced 8 years apart,
and consecutive pairs occur more than a century apart:[2] The previous transit of Venus took place on 8 June
 2004 (preceded by transits on 9 December 1874 and 6 December 1882); the next pair of transits will occur on 
10–11 December 2117 and December 2125 within the 22nd century.

Jovibarba ("beard of Jupiter") is a small genus of three species of succulent flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, endemic to mountainous regions in the southeastern quadrant of Europe. The genus is sometimes classified as a subgenus of Sempervivum, to which it is closely related. Jovibarba have pale-greenish-yellow or yellow actinomorphic flowers with about six petals, while Sempervivum have generally pinkish flowers with around twice as many petals, which open more widely than jovibarba flowers. The common name hen and chicks is applied to some Jovibarba species (and also species in several other genera).

Most jovibarbas, like sempervivums, reproduce via offsets in addition to producing seeds via sexual reproduction. Jovibarba heuffelii[1] does not produce offsets on stolons. Instead the offspring of this plant are produced within the mother plant. To propagate it must be split with a knife. The other two jovibarba species are commonly called rollers. They produce offsets that are lightly attached and easily pop off and roll away from the mother plant. Offsets survive the main rosette, which is monocarpic.
